# Robot-Movement-Web-Page


## Description 
The objective of this project is to develop a web page using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an interactive canvas where users can control a virtual robot's movements. The canvas will display the robot's path as lines based on the user's inputs of "forward," "backward," "left," and "right" movements. Additionally, the movement data will be stored in a PHPMyAdmin database for future reference. The web page will incorporate HTML for the structure and layout, CSS for styling and visual presentation, and JavaScript for capturing user actions and dynamically updating the canvas. When a user clicks on one of the movement buttons, JavaScript will be responsible for drawing the corresponding line on the canvas to represent the robot's path. Simultaneously, an AJAX request will be made to a PHP script that will store the movement data in the PHPMyAdmin database. To retrieve the last recorded movement, another PHP script will be implemented. It will query the database to fetch the most recent movement entry and return it to the web page. This information will be displayed on the web page. By combining HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP, this project aims to create a professional and user-friendly web page that allows users to control a virtual robot's movements, visualize the path on a canvas, and store and retrieve the movement data from a PHPMyAdmin database.
